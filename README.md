# Casual_Cars APK

2020/21
Final degree project created by Alejandro Feijóo Jiménez for the degree in Video Game Creation and Narration.

The main idea of the prototype, titled "Casual Cars" used for the analysis of this research, is a 2D video game where the player controls the movements of a car that must be driven to travel the maximum distance possible, avoiding a series of obstacles.

# Inctructions

Good morning, my name is Alejandro Feijóo, I'm studying Video Games and I'm doing my Final Degree Project. For this, I have created a very simple video game for Android and I would like you to play it (it takes no more than 1 minute per game), you would do me a big favor because I need it for research. It is also greatly appreciated if you share it with everyone you know, everyone can play.

Permissions:
It may ask you to enable downloads from "unknown sources", to do so follow the steps below: 
Step 1: open Settings. Step 2: tap Security. Step 3: tap the switch next to Unknown sources to enable this feature. It appears in Device Management.

During the game you will also be asked for permission from the mobile microphone, give it permission otherwise it will not work properly. There is no danger, after playing the game you can uninstall the application.

The trial will last until May 16, 2021.

Thanks for your cooperation☺
